## General Information
- To build a model-required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
1.Selecting ridge regression - due to high co-lineraity of the input variables
 0.8731941795475238,0.856196300239418

2. - Top 5 input variables 
#OverallQual_10 ( Very Excellent )
#OverallQual_9  ( Excellent )
#Neighborhood_NoRidge  ( indicating location )
#Neighborhood_Crawfor ( indicating location )
#OverallQual_8
